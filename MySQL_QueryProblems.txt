1. Write a query to display the ff columns ID (should start
with T + 11 digits of trn_teacher.id with leading zeros like
'T00000088424'), Nickname, Status and Roles (like
Trainer/Assessor/Staff) using table trn_teacher and
trn_teacher_role.

Answer:

SELECT 
    CONCAT("T",lpad(trn_teacher.id, 11,'0')) as ID,
    trn_teacher.nickname as Nickname,
    IF(trn_teacher.status=0,'Discontinued', IF(trn_teacher.status=1,'Active', 'Deactivated')) as Status,
    (SELECT 
        GROUP_CONCAT(
            IF(trn_teacher_role.role=1,'Trainer',IF(trn_teacher_role.role=2,'Assessor','Staff')) 
            SEPARATOR '/'
        ) 
        FROM trn_teacher_role 
	    WHERE trn_teacher_role.teacher_id=trn_teacher.id
    ) as Role
FROM trn_teacher;




2. Write a query to display the ff columns ID (from teacher.id),
Nickname, Open (total open slots from trn_teacher_time_table),
Reserved (total reserved slots from trn_teacher_time_table),
Taught (total taught from trn_evaluation) and NoShow (total
no_show from trn_evaluation) using all tables above. Should
show only those who are active (trn_teacher.status = 1 or 2)
and those who have both Trainer and Assessor role.

Answer: 
 
SELECT DISTINCT
	ID, Nickname,
    (SELECT COUNT(trn_time_table.id) from trn_time_table where trn_time_table.teacher_id=tmp_table.ID and trn_time_table.status=1) as Open,
    (SELECT COUNT(trn_time_table.id) from trn_time_table where trn_time_table.teacher_id=tmp_table.ID and trn_time_table.status=3) as Reserved,
    (SELECT COUNT(trn_evaluation.id) from trn_evaluation where trn_evaluation.teacher_id=tmp_table.ID and trn_evaluation.result=1) as Taught,
    (SELECT COUNT(trn_evaluation.id) from trn_evaluation where trn_evaluation.teacher_id=tmp_table.ID and trn_evaluation.result=2) as 'No Show'
FROM
	(SELECT
    	trn_teacher.id as ID,
    	trn_teacher.nickname as Nickname,
		trn_teacher.status as Status,
    	(SELECT 
        	GROUP_CONCAT(
            	IF(trn_teacher_role.role=1,'Trainer',IF(trn_teacher_role.role=2,'Assessor','Staff')) 
            	SEPARATOR '/'
        	) 
        	FROM trn_teacher_role 
	    	WHERE trn_teacher_role.teacher_id=trn_teacher.id
    	) as Role
	    FROM trn_teacher JOIN trn_teacher_role
	    ON trn_teacher.id=trn_teacher_role.teacher_id
	    WHERE (trn_teacher.status=1 OR trn_teacher.status=2)
    ) as tmp_table
WHERE Role like '%Trainer%' and Role like '%Assessor%';
